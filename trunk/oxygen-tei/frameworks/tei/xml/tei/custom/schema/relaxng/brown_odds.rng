          Note that it is mandatory to use this pattern explicitly in such cases; the simpler-looking form 
          &lt;element name="foo"/&gt; is forbidden. There is no such thing as an empty attribute. 
          An attribute such as foo="" is considered to have a value that is the empty string rather 
          than considered empty - i.e., having no value. Therefore, empty applies only to elements.

               <a:documentation>The text pattern matches zero or more text nodes.
          A match of more than one text node has no effect when it is used in ordered content models 
          (the data model used by RELAX NG for XML documents is similar to the data model of XPath 1.0, 
          and two text nodes can't be adjacent) but makes a difference when a text pattern is used in interleave. 
          Adding a single text pattern in an interleave pattern has the effect of allowing any number of text nodes, 
          which can interleave before and after each element (note that the mixed pattern is provided as a 
          shortcut to define these content models).

          A grammar pattern is matched by matching the pattern contained in the start element.
          The most common use of grammar is to validate XML documents. 
          In these cases, the start pattern specifies which elements can be used as the document root element.

          In this case, the start pattern specifies which nodes must be matched by the grammar wherever it appears in the schema.
          In every case, the named patterns defined in a grammar are considered local to this grammar.

        When define is embedded in a grammar, it defines a named pattern or combines a new definition with an existing one. 
        Named patterns are global to a grammar and can be referenced by ref in the scope of their grammar and by parentRef 
        in the scope of the grammars directly embedded in their grammar.        
        When define is embedded in include, the new definition is a redefinition. 
        It replaces the definitions from the included grammar, unless a combine attribute 
        is specified, in which case, the definitions are combined.
