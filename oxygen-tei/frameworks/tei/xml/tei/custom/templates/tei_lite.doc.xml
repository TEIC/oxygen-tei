In retrospect, it was predictable that many people should imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to TEI, or find TEI Lite to be far too heavy for their needs.</p><p>The original TEI Lite (1996) was based largely on observations of existing and previous practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as manifest in the collections of the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/">Oxford Text Archive</ref> and other collections of the period. It is therefore unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a <foreign xml:lang="la">de facto</foreign> standard, at least a common point of departure for electronic text centres and encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we actually produced this shortish, readable, manual for it also helped.</p><p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of <soCalled>Electronic Text Centers</soCalled> <!-- , many
     of whom produced their own documentation and
     tutorial materials (some examples are listed in
     <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials/"> the
     TEI Tutorials pages</ref>)--> and digital library initiatives. It was also adopted as the basis for some early TEI-conformant authoring systems, and as the basis for introductory tutorials, many of them in languages other than English (see further the list of legacy versions at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P4/Lite/"/>).</p><p>In 2002, following the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI Guidelines, which uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the TEI modification mechanism, the opportunity was taken to produce a lightly revised XML-conformant version. In 2006, a more substantially revised version based on TEI P5 was produced; this reflected the many changes between TEI P4 and TEI P5, but was not otherwise significantly different. In 2012, the TEI Technical Council, decided that a final revision should be undertaken to ensure that the documentation remained consistent with the latest (2.1) release of TEI P5. This version uses a recently added mechanism in the TEI customization architecture, which permits a customization to define only the TEI elements to be included in a schema, rather than the elements to be excluded from it. As such it is probably more resilient to change than earlier versions. </p><trailer>Lou Burnard, August 2012</trailer></div></front><body><p>This document provides an introduction to the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), by describing a specific subset of the full TEI encoding scheme. The scheme documented here can be used to encode a wide variety of commonly encountered textual features, in such a way as to maximize the usability of electronic transcriptions and to facilitate their interchange among scholars using different computer systems. It is fully compatible with the full TEI scheme, as defined by TEI document P5, <title>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</title>, as of February 2006, and available from the TEI Consortium website at <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/"/>.</p><div xml:id="U5-Intro"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed to anyone who wants to interchange information stored in an electronic form. They emphasize the interchange of textual information, but other forms of information such as images and sound are also addressed. The Guidelines are equally applicable in the creation of new resources and in the interchange of existing ones.</p><p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain features of a text in such a way as to aid the processing of that text by computer software running on different machines. This process of making explicit we call <term>markup</term> or <term>encoding</term>. Any textual representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI came into being partly because of the enormous variety of mutually incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting scholarship, and partly because of the expanding range of scholarly uses now being identified for texts in electronic form.</p><p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be expressed using a number of different formal languages. The first editions of the Guidelines used the <term>Standard Generalized Markup Language</term> (SGML); since 2002, this has been replaced by the use of the Extensible Markup Language (XML). These markup languages have in common the definition of text in terms of <term>elements</term> and <term>attributes</term>, and rules governing their appearance within a text. The TEI's use of XML is ambitious in its complexity and generality, but it is fundamentally no different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process TEI-conformant texts.</p><p>Since 2001, the TEI has been a community initiative supported by an international membership consortium. It was originally an international research project sponsored by the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, with substantial funding over its first five years from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, Directorate General XIII of the Commission of the European Communities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada and others. The Guidelines were first published in May 1994, after six years of development involving many hundreds of scholars from different academic disciplines worldwide. During the years that followed, the Guidelines became increasingly influential in the development of the digital library, in the language industries, and even in the development of the World Wide Web itself. The TEI Consortium was set up in January 2001, and a year later produced an edition of the Guidelines entirely revised for XML compatibility. In 2004, it set about a major revision of the Guidelines to take full advantage of new schema languages, the first release of which appeared in 2005. This revision of the TEI Lite document conforms to version 2.1 of this most recent edition of the Guidelines, TEI P5, released in June 2012.</p><p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI were defined by the closing statement of a planning conference held at Vassar College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these <soCalled>Poughkeepsie Principles</soCalled> were further elaborated in a series of design documents. The Guidelines, say these design documents, should: <list><item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for research;</item><item>be simple, clear, and concrete;</item><item>be easy for researchers to use without special-purpose software;</item><item>allow the rigorous definition and efficient processing of texts;</item><item>provide for user-defined extensions;</item><item>conform to existing and emergent standards.</item></list></p><p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines to have wide acceptability, it was important to ensure that: <list type="ordered"><item>the common core of textual features be easily shared;</item><item>additional specialist features be easy to add to (or remove from) a text;</item><item>multiple parallel encodings of the same feature should be possible;</item><item>the richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very small minimal requirement;</item><item>adequate documentation of the text and its encoding should be provided.</item></list></p><p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements and recommendations resulting from those design goals, which is called <title>TEI Lite</title>.</p><p>In selecting from the several hundred elements defined by the full TEI scheme, we have tried to identify a useful <soCalled>starter set</soCalled>, comprising the elements which almost every user should know about. Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable in understanding the full TEI scheme and in knowing how to integrate specialized parts of it into the general TEI framework.</p><p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows: <list type="simple"><item>it should be able to handle adequately a reasonably wide variety of texts, at the level of detail found in existing practice (as demonstrated in, for example, the holdings of the Oxford Text Archive);</item><item>it should be useful for the production of new documents (such as this one) as well as the encoding of existing texts;</item><item>it should be usable with a wide range of existing XML software;</item><item>it should be a pure subset of the full TEI scheme and defined using the customizaticon methods described in the TEI Guidelines;</item><item>it should be as small and simple as is consistent with the other goals.</item></list> The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or herself.</p><p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as suits a tutorial text, the reader should be aware that it does not cover every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of the elements described here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves, which should be consulted for authoritative reference information on these, and on the many others which are not described here. Some basic knowledge of XML is assumed.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-eg"><head>A Short Example</head><p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when a passage of prose is typed into a computer by someone with little sense of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of electronic texts. In an ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate optical scanner. It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the printed text, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing blanks to represent the layout of the original headings and page breaks, and so forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard are needed (such as the accented letter <mentioned>a</mentioned> in <mentioned>faàl</mentioned> or the long dash), it attempts to mimic their appearance.</p><p><eg xml:space="preserve">
                                CHAPTER 38

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                            474

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

As a trivial example, note that in the second example, end-of-line hyphenation has been silently removed. Conceivably Brontë (or her printer) intended the word <q>honeymoon</q> to appear as <q>honey-moon</q> on its second appearance, though this seems unlikely: our decision to focus on Brontë's text, rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition, makes it impossible to be certain. This is an instance of the fundamental <emph>selectivity</emph> of any encoding. An encoding makes explicit only those textual features of importance to the encoder. It is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short passage might readily be extended. For example: <list type="simple"><item>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided; </item><item>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;</item><item>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</item><item>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding text;</item><item>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context could be prefixed to it;</item><item>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc., could be provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category codes;</item><item>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;</item><item>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the encoding, with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and the analysis, or between the text and one or more translations of it;</item><item>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other media.</item></list></p><p>TEI-recommended ways of carrying out most of these are described in the remainder of this document. The TEI scheme as a whole also provides for an enormous range of other possibilities, of which we cite only a few: <list type="simple"><item>detailed analysis of the components of names;</item><item>detailed meta-information providing thesaurus-style information about the text's origins or topics;</item><item>information about the printing history or manuscript variations exhibited by a particular series of versions of the text.</item></list> For recommendations on these and many other possibilities, the full Guidelines should be consulted.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-struc"><head>The Structure of a TEI Text</head><p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a <term>TEI header</term> (marked up as a <ref target="#TEI.teiHeader">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</ref> element) and (b) the transcription of the text proper (marked up as a <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element). These two elements are combined together to form a single <ref target="#TEI.TEI">&lt;TEI&gt;</ref> element, which must be declared within the TEI namespace<note place="foot">A <term>namespace</term> is an XML concept. Its function is to identify the vocabulary from which a group of element names are drawn, using a standard identifier resembling a web address. The namespace for all TEI elements is <code>http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</code></note>.</p><p>The TEI header provides information analogous to that provided by the title page of a printed text. It has up to four parts: a bibliographic description of the machine-readable text, a description of the way it has been encoded, a non-bibliographic description of the text (a <term>text profile</term>), and a revision history. The header is described in more detail in section <ptr target="#U5-header"/>.</p><p>A TEI text may be <term>unitary</term> (a single work) or <term>composite</term> (a collection of single works, such as an anthology). In either case, the text may have an optional <term>front</term> or <term>back</term>. In between is the <term>body</term> of the text, which, in the case of a composite text, may consist of <term>group</term>s, each containing more groups or texts.</p><p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader><text><front><!-- [ front matter ... ] --></front><body><!-- [ body of text ... ]  --></body><back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] --></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>A composite text also has an optional front and back. In between occur one or more groups of texts, each with its own optional front and back matter. A composite text will thus be encoded using an overall structure like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><TEI><teiHeader><!--[ header information for the composite ]--></teiHeader><text><front><!--[ front matter for the composite  ]--></front><group><text><front><!--[ front matter of first text ]--></front><body><!--[ body of first text  ]--></body><back><!--[ back matter of first text ]--></back></text><text><front><!--[ front matter of second text]--></front><body><!--[ body of second text  ]--></body><back><!--[ back matter of second text ]--></back></text><!--[ more texts or groups of texts here ]--></group><back><!--[ back matter for the composite  ]--></back></text></TEI></egXML></p><p>It is also possible to define a composite of complete TEI texts, each with its own header. Such a collection is known as a <term>TEI corpus</term>, and may itself have a header: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><teiCorpus><teiHeader><!--[header information for the corpus]--></teiHeader><TEI><teiHeader><!--[header information for first text]--></teiHeader><text><!--[first text in corpus]--></text></TEI><TEI><teiHeader><!--[header information for second text]--></teiHeader><text><!--[second text in corpus]--></text></TEI></teiCorpus></egXML> It is also possible to create a composite of corpora -- that is, one <ref target="#TEI.teiCorpus">&lt;teiCorpus&gt;</ref> element may contain many nested <ref target="#TEI.teiCorpus">&lt;teiCorpus&gt;</ref> elements rather than many nested <ref target="#TEI.TEI">&lt;TEI&gt;</ref> elements, to any depth considered necessary.</p><p>In the remainder of this document, we discuss chiefly simple text structures. The discussion in each case consists of a short list of relevant TEI <term>elements</term> with a brief definition of each, followed by definitions for any <term>attributes</term> specific to that element, and a reference to any <term>classes</term> of which the element is a member. These references are linked to full specifications for each object, as given in the TEI <title>Guidelines</title>. In most cases, short examples are also given.</p><p>For example, here are the elements discussed so far: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.TEI">TEI</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">TEI document</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a single TEI-conformant document, comprising a TEI header and a text, either in isolation or as part of a <ref target="#TEI.teiCorpus">&lt;teiCorpus&gt;</ref> element.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.teiHeader">teiHeader</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">TEI header</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">supplies the descriptive and declarative information making up an electronic title page for every TEI-conformant document.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.text">text</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a single text of any kind, whether unitary or composite, for example a poem or drama, a collection of essays, a novel, a dictionary, or a corpus sample.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.teiCorpus">teiCorpus</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains the whole of a TEI encoded corpus, comprising a single corpus header and one or more TEI elements, each containing a single text header and a text.</seg></item></list></p></div><div xml:id="U5-body"><head>Encoding the Body</head><p>As indicated above, a simple TEI document at the textual level consists of the following elements: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.front">front</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">front matter</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any prefatory matter (headers, title page, prefaces, dedications, etc.) found at the start of a document, before the main body.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.group">group</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains the body of a composite text, grouping together a sequence of distinct texts (or groups of such texts) which are regarded as a unit for some purpose, for example the collected works of an author, a sequence of prose essays, etc.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.body">body</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">text body</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains the whole body of a single unitary text, excluding any front or back matter.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.back">back</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">back matter</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any appendixes, etc. following the main part of a text.</seg></item></list> Elements specific to front and back matter are described below in section <ptr target="#U5-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss the elements making up the body of a text.</p><div xml:id="divs"><head>Text Division Elements</head><p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or these paragraphs may be grouped together into chapters, sections, subsections, etc. Each paragraph is tagged using the <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> tag. The <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element is used to represent any such grouping of paragraphs. <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.p">p</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">paragraph</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks paragraphs in prose.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.div">div</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">text division</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a subdivision of the front, body, or back of a text.</seg></item></list></p><p>The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element may be used to supply a conventional name for this category of text division, or otherwise distinguish them. Typical values might be <q>book</q>, <q>chapter</q>, <q>section</q>, <q>part</q>, <q>poem</q>, <q>song</q>, etc. For a given project, it will usually be advisable to define and adhere to a specific list of such values.</p><p>A <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element may itself contain further, nested, <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref>s, thus mimicking the traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as parts, containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in general conform to this simple hierarchic model.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute may be used to supply a unique identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>. It is often useful to provide an <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute for every major structural unit in a text, and to derive its values in some systematic way, for example by appending a section number to a short code for the title of the work in question, as in the examples below. It is particularly useful to supply such identifiers if the resource concerned is to be made available over the web, since they make it much easier for other web-based applications to link directly to the corresponding parts of your text.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or alternatively) a short mnemonic name or number for a division, or any other element. If a conventional form of reference or abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute is the place to record it; unlike the identifier supplied by <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi>, it does not need to be unique.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute may be used to specify the language of the division. Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">rend</hi> attribute may be used to supply information about the rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-hilites"/> below. As with the <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute, a project will often find it useful to predefine the possible values for this attribute, but TEI Lite does not constrain it in anyway.</p><p>These four attributes, <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi>, <hi rend="att">n</hi>, <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi>, and <hi rend="att">rend</hi> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema: they are <term>global attributes</term>. Other global attributes defined in the TEI Lite scheme are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>The value of every <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute should be unique within a document. One simple way of ensuring that this is so is to make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the document. For example, Smith's <title>Wealth of Nations</title> as first published consists of five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might define <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> values for this structure as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book"><div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><!-- ... --><div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter"><div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part"><!-- ... --></div></div><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book"><!-- ... --></div></body></egXML></p><p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> and <hi rend="att">n</hi> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical reference scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of the work. For example, in a novel divided into books each containing chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme such as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><body><div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="volume"><div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS012" n="2" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div></div><div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="volume"><div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div><div xml:id="TS022" n="4" type="chapter"><!-- ... --></div></div></body></egXML> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters. The chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> values specified allow them to be regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p></div><div xml:id="h25"><head>Headings and Closings</head><p>Every <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> may have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a trailer such as <q>End of Chapter 1</q> at its end. The following elements may be used to transcribe them: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.head">head</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">heading</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any type of heading, for example the title of a section, or the heading of a list, glossary, manuscript description, etc.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.trailer">trailer</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a closing title or footer appearing at the end of a division of a text.</seg></item></list> Some other elements which may be necessary at the beginning or ending of text divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p><p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a matter for the individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is completely regular (for example <q>Chapter 1</q>) or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g. <code>&lt;div type="chapter" n="1"&gt;</code>), it may be omitted; where it contains otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's <title>Under the Greenwood Tree</title> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="Part"><div xml:id="UGT11" n="1" type="Chapter"><head>Mellstock-Lane</head><p>To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ... </p></div></div></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="vedr"><head>Prose, Verse and Drama</head><p>As in the Bronte example above, the paragraphs making up a textual division are tagged with the <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> tag. In poetic or dramatic texts different tags are needed, to represent verse lines and stanzas in the first case, or individual speeches and stage directions in the second. : <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.l">l</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">verse line</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a single, possibly incomplete, line of verse.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.lg">lg</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">line group</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains one or more verse lines functioning as a formal unit, e.g. a stanza, refrain, verse paragraph, etc.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.sp">sp</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">speech</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains an individual speech in a performance text, or a passage presented as such in a prose or verse text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.speaker">speaker</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a specialized form of heading or label, giving the name of one or more speakers in a dramatic text or fragment.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.stage">stage</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">stage direction</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any kind of stage direction within a dramatic text or fragment.</seg></item></list></p><p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and stanzas are tagged: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><lg n="I"><l>I Sing the progresse of a

The <ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb/&gt;</ref> element described in section <ptr target="#U5-pln"/> might additionally be used to mark typographic lines if so desired.</p><p>Here is the end of a famous dramatic text, in which speeches and stage directions are marked: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Pull on your trousers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Estragon</speaker><p>You want me to pull off my trousers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p>Pull <emph>on</emph> your trousers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Vladimir</speaker><p><stage>(realizing his trousers are down)</stage>.

In this case, it is quite common to find that verse lines are split between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use the <hi rend="att">part</hi> attribute to indicate that the lines so fragmented are incomplete : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="Act" n="I"><head>ACT I</head><div type="Scene" n="1"><head>SCENE I</head><stage rend="italic"> Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two Sentinels, at several doors</stage><sp><speaker>Barn</speaker><l part="Y">Who's there?</l></sp><sp><speaker>Fran</speaker><l>Nay, answer me.

The global <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute should be used to supply the number of the page or line beginning at the tag.</p><p>When working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record its pagination, if only to simplify later proof-reading. It is also useful for synchronizing an encoded text with a set of page images. Recording the line breaks may be useful for similar reasons. <!--; treatment of end-of-line
     hyphenation in printed source texts will require some consideration.--></p><p>If features such as pagination or lineation are marked for more than one edition, specify the edition in question using the <hi rend="att">ed</hi> attribute, and supply as many tags are necessary. For example, in the following passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different editions (<hi rend="val">ED1</hi> and <hi rend="val">ED2</hi>) <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully

       over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p></egXML></p><p>A special attribute <hi rend="att">break</hi> may be used to indicate whether or not this empty element is considered as a word-breaking, irrespective of any adjacent whitespace. For example, in the following encoded sample:</p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb/&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.lb">&lt;lb/&gt;</ref> elements are special cases of the general class of <term>milestone</term> elements which mark reference points within a text. The generic <ref target="#TEI.milestone">&lt;milestone/&gt;</ref> element can mark any kind of reference point: for example, a column break, the start of a new kind of section not otherwise tagged, or in general any significant change in the text not marked by an XML element. The names used for types of unit and for editions referred to by the <hi rend="att">ed</hi> and <hi rend="att">unit</hi> attributes may be chosen freely, but should be documented in the header <ref target="#TEI.refsDecl">&lt;refsDecl&gt;</ref> element (see <ptr target="#refsdecl"/>). The <ref target="#TEI.milestone">&lt;milestone/&gt;</ref> element may be used to replace the others, or the others may be used as a set; they should not be mixed arbitrarily.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-hilites"><head>Marking Highlighted Phrases</head><div xml:id="faces"><head>Changes of Typeface, etc.</head><p>Highlighted words or phrases are those made visibly different from the rest of the text, typically by a change of type font, handwriting style, ink colour etc., which is intended to draw the reader's attention to some associated change.</p><p>The global <hi rend="att">rend</hi> attribute can be attached to any element, and used wherever necessary to specify details of the highlighting used for it in the source. For example, a heading rendered in bold might be tagged <code>&lt;head rend="bold"&gt;</code>, and one in italic <code>&lt;head rend="italic"&gt;</code>.</p><p>The values to be used for the <hi rend="att">rend</hi> attribute are not specified by the TEI Guidelines, since they will depend entirely on the needs of the particular project. Some typical values might include <code>italic</code>, <code>bold</code> <!--, <code>sup</code>(erior)--> etc. for font variations; <code>center</code>, <code>right</code> etc. for alignment; <code>large</code>, <code>small</code> etc. for size; <code>smallcaps</code>, <code>allcaps</code> etc. for type variants and so on. Several such words may be used in combination as necessary, but no formal syntax is proposed. The full TEI Guidelines provide more rigorous mechanisms, using other W3C standards such as CSS, as an alternative to the use of <hi rend="att">rend</hi>.</p><p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons for such changes of rendering in a text.

        lexicographer as <q>a harmless drudge.</q></p></egXML></p><p>To record how a quotation was printed (for example, <term>in-line</term> or set off as a <term>display</term> or <term>block quotation</term>), the <hi rend="att">rend</hi> attribute should be used. This may also be used to indicate the kind of quotation marks used.</p><p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by ending the quotation and beginning it again after the interruption, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><q>Who-e debel you?</q> — he at last said —
         <q>you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began
        flourishing about me in the dark.</p></egXML> If it is important to convey the idea that the two <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref> elements together make up a single speech, the linking attributes <hi rend="att">next</hi> and <hi rend="att">prev</hi> may be used, as described in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p><p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or speaker, using the <hi rend="att">who</hi> attribute, whether or not this is explicit in the text, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q who="#Wilson">Spaulding, he came
        down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he
         says:—<q who="#Spaulding">I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed
        man.</q></q></egXML> This example also demonstrates how quotations may be embedded within other quotations: one speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p><p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation marks are replaced by the tags or whether the tags are added and the quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are removed from the text, the <hi rend="att">rend</hi> attribute may be used to record the way in which they were rendered in the copy text.</p><p>The full TEI Guidelines provide additional elements to distinguish direct speech, quotation, and other typical uses of quotation mark although it is not always possible and may not be considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in a text. For simplicity, only <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref> (which may be used for any such case) has been included in TEI Lite.</p></div><div xml:id="z636"><head>Foreign Words or Expressions</head><p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts may be tagged as such in one of two ways. If the word or phrase is already tagged for some reason, the element indicated should bear a value for the global <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute indicating the language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element <ref target="#TEI.foreign">&lt;foreign&gt;</ref> may be used, again using the <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute. For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>John has real <foreign xml:lang="fr">savoir-faire</foreign>.</p><p>Have you read <title xml:lang="de">Die

The global <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute may be attached to any element to show that it uses some other language than that of the surrounding text.</p><p>The codes used to identify languages, supplied on the <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute, must be constructed in a particular way, and must conform to common Internet standards<note place="foot">The relevant standard is <title>Best Current Practice 47</title> (<ptr target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47"/>).

This may not be possible for example with marginalia, which may not be anchored to an exact location. For simplicity, it may be adequate to position marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other element. Notes may also be placed in a separate division of the text (as end-notes are, in printed books) and linked to the relevant portion of the text using their <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute may be used to supply the number or identifier of a note if this is required.

The <ref target="#TEI.ptr">&lt;ptr/&gt;</ref> element would be used for a cross reference which is to be indicated by some non-verbal means such as a symbol or icon, or in an electronic text by a button. It is also useful in document production systems, where the formatter can generate the correct verbal form of the cross reference.</p><p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ref target="#SEC12">section 12 on
        page 34</ref>.</egXML> <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">See especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML> The value of the <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute on either element may be the identifier of some other element within the current document. The passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an identifier, and must therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following example, the cross reference is to a <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... see especially <ptr target="#SEC12"/>. ... <div xml:id="SEC12"><head>Concerning Identifiers</head><!-- ... --></div></egXML></p><p>Because the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute is global, any element in a TEI document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ... this is
       discussed in <ref target="#pspec">the paragraph on links</ref> ... <p xml:id="pspec">Links
        may be made to any kind of element ...</p></egXML></p><p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an <ref target="#TEI.anchor">&lt;anchor/&gt;</ref> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are described as follows: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.anchor">anchor/</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">anchor point</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">attaches an identifier to a point within a text, whether or not it corresponds with a textual element.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.seg">seg</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">arbitrary segment</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">represents any segmentation of text below the <soCalled>chunk</soCalled> level.</seg></item></list></p><p>In the following (imaginary) example, <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> elements have been used to represent points in this text which are to be linked in some way to other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in the second, to a sequence of words: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> Returning to <ref target="#ABCD">the point where I
        dozed off</ref>, I noticed that <ref target="#EFGH">three words</ref> had been circled in
       red by a previous reader</egXML></p><p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers (<code>ABCD</code> and <code>EFGH</code> in this example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document. Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers, the <ref target="#TEI.anchor">&lt;anchor/&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"> ....
        <anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH"> ...
       </seg> ...</egXML></p><p>The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish amongst different purposes for which these general purpose elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p></div><div xml:id="xptrs"><head>Pointing to other documents</head><p>So far, we have shown how the elements <ref target="#TEI.ptr">&lt;ptr/&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.ref">&lt;ref&gt;</ref> may be used for cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same document as their source. However, the same elements may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML document or resource, such as a document on the web, or a database component. This is possible because the value of the <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute may be any valid <term>universal resource indicator</term> (URI)<note>A full definition of this term, defined by the W3C (the consortium which manages the development and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is the familiar <soCalled>URL</soCalled> used to indicate a web page, such as <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code></note>.</p><p>A URI may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2</code>. The sharp sign indicates that what follows it is the identifier of an element to be located within the XML document identified by what precedes it: this example will therefore locate an element which has an <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute value of <hi rend="val">SEC2</hi> within the document retrieved from <code>http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</code>. In the examples we have discussed so far, the part to the left of the sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p><p>Parts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more sophisticated mechanisms using a special language called Xpath, also defined by the W3C. This is particularly useful where the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers and must therefore be located by some other means. <!--A full specification of the language is well beyond
      the scope of this document; here we provide only a flavour of its power. </p>
     <p>In the XPath language, locations are defined as a series of <term>steps</term>, each one
      identifying some part of the document, often in terms of the locations identified by the
      previous step. For example, you would point to the third sentence of the second paragraph of
      chapter two by selecting chapter two in the first step, the second paragraph in the second
      step, and the third sentence in the last step. A step can be defined in terms of the document
      tree itself, using such concepts as <val>parent</val>, <val>descendent</val>,
       <val>preceding</val>, etc. or, more loosely, in terms of text patterns, word or character
      positions. --></p></div><div xml:id="xatts"><head>Special kinds of Linking</head><p>The following special purpose <term>linking</term> attributes are defined for every element in the TEI Lite scheme: <list type="gloss"><label><hi rend="att">ana</hi></label><item>links an element with its interpretation.</item><label><hi rend="att">corresp</hi></label><item>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</item><label><hi rend="att">next</hi></label><item>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</item><label><hi rend="att">prev</hi></label><item>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</item></list></p><p>The <hi rend="att">ana</hi> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined somewhere within a document, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#U5-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence <q>John loves Nancy</q> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg type="sentence" ana="SVO"><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">John</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#VVI">loves</seg><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1">Nancy</seg></seg></egXML> This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the document of elements with identifiers <hi rend="val">SVO</hi>, <hi rend="val">NP1</hi>, and <hi rend="val">VV1</hi> where the significance of these particular codes is explained. Note the use of the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element to mark particular components of the analysis, distinguished by the <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">corresp</hi> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of representing some form of correspondence between two elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it may be used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><seg xml:lang="fr" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1">Jean
        aime Nancy</seg><seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1">John loves
       Nancy</seg></egXML></p><p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the following example, it has been used to represent the correspondences between <q rend="inline" type="inline">the show</q> and <q>Shirley</q>, and between <q>NBC</q> and <q>the network</q>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p><title xml:id="shirley">Shirley</title>, which
        made its Friday night debut only a month ago, was not listed on <name xml:id="nbc">NBC</name>'s new schedule, although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="#nbc">the network</seg>
        says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="#shirley">the show</seg> still is being
       considered.</p></egXML></p><p>The <hi rend="att">next</hi> and <hi rend="att">prev</hi> attributes provide a simple way of linking together the components of a discontinuous element, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q xml:id="Q1a" next="#Q1b">Who-e debel you?</q> —
       he at last said — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a">you no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.</q> And so

This element is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript materials. For example, the character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional representation for the word <hi rend="val">per</hi> is commonly encountered in Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may choose to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>per</expan></egXML></p><p>The expansion corresponding with an abbreviated form may not always contain the same letters as the abbreviation. Where it does, however, common editorial practice is to italicize or otherwise signal which letters have been supplied. The <ref target="#TEI.expan">&lt;expan&gt;</ref> element should not be used for this purpose since its function is to indicate an expanded form, not a part of one. For example, consider the common abbreviation <hi rend="val">wt</hi> (for <hi rend="val">with</hi>) found in medieval texts. In a modern edition, an editor might wish to represent this as <soCalled>w<hi rend="it">i</hi>t<hi rend="it">h</hi></soCalled>, italicising the letters not found in the source. One simple means of achieving that would be an encoding such as the follow<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><expan>w<hi rend="it">i</hi>t<hi rend="it">h</hi></expan></egXML> The full TEI also provides elements <gi>ex</gi> and <gi>am</gi> for use in this situation, but these are not included in the TEI Lite schema.</p><p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the <ref target="#TEI.choice">&lt;choice&gt;</ref> element mentioned above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><choice><abbr>wt</abbr><expan>with</expan></choice></egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-names"><head>Names, Dates, and Numbers</head><p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of <soCalled>data-like</soCalled> features which may appear almost anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to objects external to the text itself, such as the names of persons and places, numbers and dates. They also pose particular problems for many natural language processing (NLP) applications because of the variety of ways in which they may be presented within a text. The elements described here, by making such features explicit, reduce the complexity of processing texts containing them.</p><div xml:id="nomen"><head>Names and Referring Strings</head><p>A <term>referring string</term> is a phrase which refers to some person, place, object, etc. Two elements are provided to mark such strings: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.rs">rs</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">referencing string</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a general purpose name or referring string.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.name">name</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">name, proper noun</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a proper noun or noun phrase.</seg></item></list></p><p>The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute is used to distinguish amongst (for example) names of persons, places and organizations, where this is possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><q>My dear <rs type="person">Mr. Bennet</rs>, </q>

       said <rs type="person">his lady</rs> to him one day...</egXML></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.name">&lt;name&gt;</ref> element by contrast is provided for the special case of referencing strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may be used synonymously with the <ref target="#TEI.rs">&lt;rs&gt;</ref> element, or nested within it if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper nouns.</p><p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms usually required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague. Moreover, name prefixes such as <mentioned>van</mentioned> or <mentioned>de la</mentioned>, may or may not be included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the language and country of origin of the bearer.</p><p>The <hi rend="att">key</hi> attribute provides an alternative normalized identifier for the object being named, like a database record key.

        investigations, the local population consisted of between 200 and 250
       inhabitants.</p></egXML> Although adequate for many simple applications, these methods have two inconveniences: if the name occurs many times, then its regularised form must be repeated many times; and the burden of additional XML markup in the body of the text may be inconvenient to maintain and complex to process.

        engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading a group of revellers.</figDesc></figure></egXML></p><p>These cases should be carefully distinguished from the case where an encoded text is complemented by a collection of digital images, maintained as a distinct resource. The <hi rend="att">facs</hi> attribute may be used to associate any element in an encoded text with a digital facsimile of it. In the simple case where only page images are available, the <hi rend="att">facs</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.pb">&lt;pb/&gt;</ref> element may be used to associate each image with an appropriate point in the text: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><text><pb facs="page1.png" n="1"/><!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here --><pb facs="page2.png" n="2"/><!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here --></text></egXML> This method is only appropriate in the simple case where each digital image file <ident>page1.png</ident> etc. corresponds with a single transcribed and encoded page. If more detailed alignment of image and transcription is required, for example because the image files actually represent double page spreads, more sophisticated mechanisms are provided in the full TEI Guidelines.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-anal"><head>Interpretation and Analysis</head><p>It is often said that <emph>all</emph> markup is a form of interpretation or analysis. While it is certainly difficult, and may be impossible, to distinguish firmly between <soCalled>objective</soCalled> and <soCalled>subjective</soCalled> information in any universal way, it remains true that judgments concerning the latter are typically regarded as more likely to provide controversy than those concerning the former. Many scholars therefore prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible to alert the reader that they are considered more open to dispute, than the rest of the markup. This section describes some of the elements provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need.</p><div><head>Orthographic Sentences</head><p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary to intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label for use as a sort of <soCalled>canonical reference</soCalled>. To facilitate such uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may conveniently be represented using the following element: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.s">s</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">s-unit</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a sentence-like division of a text.</seg></item></list></p><p>As the name suggests, the <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element is most commonly used (in linguistic applications at least) for marking <term>orthographic sentences</term>, that is, units defined by orthographic features such as punctuation. For example, the passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><pb n="474"/><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><s n="001">Reader, I married him.</s><s n="002">A quiet wedding we had:</s><s n="003">he
          and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.</s><s n="004">When we got back from
          church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner, and
          John cleaning the knives, and I said —</s></p><p><q><s n="005">Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.</s></q> ... </p></div></egXML> Note that <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> elements cannot nest: the beginning of one <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element implies that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown above, it is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in the text being analysed will be contained by exactly one <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element, whose identifier can then be used to specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the document, then the <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> attribute might be used in preference to the <hi rend="att">n</hi> used in the above example.</p></div><div><head>Words and punctuation</head><p>Tokenization, that is, the identification of lexical or non-lexical tokens within a text, is a very common requirement for all kinds of textual analysis, and not an entirely trivial one. The decision as to whether, for example, <q>can't</q> in English or <q>du</q> in French should be treated as one word or two is not simple. Consequently it is often useful to make explicit the preferred tokenization in a marked up text. The following elements are available for this purpose: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.w">w</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">word</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">represents a grammatical (not necessarily orthographic) word.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.pc">pc</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">punctuation character</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a character or string of characters regarded as constituting a single punctuation mark.</seg></item></list></p><p>For example, the output from a part of speech tagger might be recorded in TEI Lite as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><s n="1"><w ana="#NP0">Marley</w><w ana="#VBD">was</w><w ana="#AJ0">dead</w><pc>:</pc><w ana="#TO0">to</w><w ana="#VBB">begin</w><w ana="#PRP">with</w><pc>. </pc></s></egXML></p><p>In this example, each word has been decorated with an automatically generated part of speech code, using the <hi rend="att">ana</hi> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. The <ref target="#TEI.w">&lt;w&gt;</ref> also provides for each word to be associated with a root form or lemma, either explicitly using the <hi rend="att">lemma</hi> attribute, or by reference, using the <hi rend="att">lemmaRef</hi> attribute, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...<w ana="#VBD" lemma="be" lemmaRef="http://www.myLexicon.com/be">was</w> ... </egXML></p></div><div><head>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</head><p>The <ref target="#TEI.w">&lt;w&gt;</ref> element is a specialisation of the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element which has already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#U5-ptrs"/>); it identifies some phrase-level portion of text to which the encoder may assign a user-specified <hi rend="att">type</hi>, as well as a unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for which there is no other provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p><p>For example, the Guidelines provide no <soCalled>apostrophe</soCalled> element to mark parts of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer) directly. One approach might be to regard these as instances of the <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref> element, distinguished from others by an appropriate value for the <hi rend="att">who</hi> attribute. A possibly simpler, and certainly more general, solution would however be to use the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p><seg type="apostrophe">Reader, I married him.</seg> A quiet wedding we had: ...</p></div></egXML> The <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element can take any value, and so can be used to record phrase-level phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record the values used and their significance in the header.</p><p>A <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element of one type (unlike the <ref target="#TEI.s">&lt;s&gt;</ref> element which it superficially resembles) can be nested within a <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> element of the same or another type. This enables quite complex structures to be represented; some examples were given in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. However, because it must respect the requirement that elements be properly nested and may not cut across each other, it cannot cope with the common requirement to associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments of a text which may completely ignore the document hierarchy. It also requires that the interpretation itself be represented by a single coded value in the <hi rend="att">type</hi> attribute.</p><p>Neither restriction applies to the <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> element, which provides powerful features for the encoding of quite complex interpretive information in a relatively straightforward manner. <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.interp">interp</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">interpretation</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">summarizes a specific interpretative annotation which can be linked to a span of text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.interpGrp">interpGrp</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">interpretation group</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">collects together a set of related interpretations which share responsibility or type.</seg></item></list> These elements allow the encoder to specify both the class of an interpretation, and the particular instance of that class which the interpretation involves. Thus, whereas with <ref target="#TEI.seg">&lt;seg&gt;</ref> one can say simply that something is an apostrophe, with <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> one can say that it is an instance (apostrophe) of a larger class (rhetorical figures).</p><p>Moreover, <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> is a <soCalled>stand off</soCalled> element: it does not surround the segments of text which it describes, but instead is linked to the passage in question either by means of the <hi rend="att">ana</hi> attribute discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> above, or by means of its own <hi rend="att">inst</hi> attribute. This means that any kind of analysis can be represented, independently of the document hierarchy, as well as facilitating the grouping of analyses of a particular type together. A special purpose <ref target="#TEI.interpGrp">&lt;interpGrp&gt;</ref> element is provided for the latter purpose.</p><p>For example, suppose that you wish to mark such diverse aspects of a text as themes or subject matter, rhetorical figures, and the locations of individual scenes of the narrative. Different portions of our sample passage from <title>Jane Eyre</title> for example, might be associated with the rhetorical figures of apostrophe, hyperbole, and metaphor; with subject-matter references to churches, servants, cooking, postal service, and honeymoons; and with scenes located in the church, in the kitchen, and in an unspecified location (drawing room?).</p><p>These interpretations could be placed anywhere within the <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element; it is however good practice to put them all in the same place (e.g. a separate section of the front or back matter), as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interp xml:id="fig-apos-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="fig-hyp-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="figureOfSpeech">hyperbole</interp><interp xml:id="set-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="setting">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-church-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-serv-1" resp="#LB-MSM" type="reference">servants</interp></p></div></back></egXML></p><p>The evident redundancy of this encoding can be considerably reduced by using the <ref target="#TEI.interpGrp">&lt;interpGrp&gt;</ref> element to group together all those <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> elements which share common attribute values, as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><back><div type="Interpretations"><p><interpGrp type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="fig-apos">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="fig-hyp">hyperbole</interp><interp xml:id="fig-meta">metaphor</interp></interpGrp><interpGrp type="scene-setting" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="set-church">church</interp><interp xml:id="set-kitch">kitchen</interp><interp xml:id="set-unspec">unspecified</interp></interpGrp><interpGrp type="reference" resp="#LB-MSM"><interp xml:id="ref-church">church</interp><interp xml:id="ref-serv">servants</interp><interp xml:id="ref-cook">cooking</interp></interpGrp></p></div></back></egXML></p><p>Once these interpretation elements have been defined, they can be linked with the parts of the text to which they apply in either or both of two ways. The <hi rend="att">ana</hi> attribute can be used on whichever element is appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><div type="chapter" n="38"><p xml:id="P38.1" ana="#set-church #set-kitch"><s xml:id="P38.1.1" ana="#fig-apos">Reader, I
          married him.</s></p></div></egXML> Note in this example that since the paragraph has two settings (in the church and in the kitchen), the identifiers of both have been supplied.</p><p>Alternatively, the <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> elements can point to all the parts of the text to which they apply, using their <hi rend="att">inst</hi> attribute: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="fig-apos-2" type="figureOfSpeech" resp="#LB-MSM" inst="#P38.1.1">apostrophe</interp><interp xml:id="set-church-2" type="scene-setting" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM">church</interp><interp xml:id="set-kitchen-2" type="scene-setting" inst="#P38.1" resp="#LB-MSM">kitchen</interp></egXML></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> element is not limited to any particular type of analysis. The literary analysis shown above is but one possibility; one could equally well use <ref target="#TEI.interp">&lt;interp&gt;</ref> to capture a linguistic part-of-speech analysis. For example, the example sentence given in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> assumes a linguistic analysis which might be represented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><interp xml:id="NP1" type="pos">noun
        phrase, singular</interp><interp xml:id="VV1" type="pos">inflected verb, present-tense
        singular</interp> ... </egXML></p></div></div><div xml:id="U5-techdoc"><head>Technical Documentation</head><p>Although the focus of this document is on the use of the TEI scheme for the encoding of existing <soCalled>pre-electronic</soCalled> documents, the same scheme may also be used for the encoding of new documents. In the preparation of new documents (such as this one), XML has much to recommend it: the document's structure can be clearly represented, and the same electronic text can be re-used for many purposes — to provide both online hypertext or browsable versions and well-formatted typeset versions from a common source for example.</p><p>To facilitate this, the TEI Lite schema includes some elements for marking features of technical documents in general, and of XML-related documents in particular.</p><div><head>Additional Elements for Technical Documents</head><p>The following elements may be used to mark particular features of technical documents: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.eg">eg</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">example</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains any kind of illustrative example.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.code">code</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains literal code from some formal language such as a programming language.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.ident">ident</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">identifier</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains an identifier or name for an object of some kind in a formal language. <ref target="#TEI.ident">&lt;ident&gt;</ref> is used for tokens such as variable names, class names, type names, function names etc. in formal programming languages.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.gi">gi</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">element name</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains the name (generic identifier) of an element.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.att">att</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">attribute</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains the name of an attribute appearing within running text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.formula">formula</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a mathematical or other formula.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.val">val</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">value</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a single attribute value.</seg></item></list></p><p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to encode a passage from a tutorial introducing the Fortran programming language: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>It is traditional to introduce a language with a
        program like the following: <eg xml:space="preserve"> CHAR*12 GRTG
GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD' 
PRINT *, GRTG 
END
        </eg></p><p>This simple example first declares a variable <ident>GRTG</ident>, in the line
         <code>CHAR*12 GRTG</code>, which identifies <ident>GRTG</ident> as consisting of 12 bytes
        of type <ident>CHAR</ident>. To this variable, the value <val>HELLO WORLD</val> is then
        assigned.</p></egXML></p><p>A formatting application, given a text like that above, can be instructed to format examples appropriately (e.g. to preserve line breaks, or to use a distinctive font). Similarly, the use of tags such as <ref target="#TEI.ident">&lt;ident&gt;</ref> greatly facilitates the construction of a useful index.</p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.formula">&lt;formula&gt;</ref> element should be used to enclose a mathematical or chemical formula presented within the text as a distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety of special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text, it will usually be necessary to present the body of the formula in a specialized notation. The notation used should be specified by the <hi rend="att">notation</hi> attribute, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><formula notation="tex"> \begin{math}E =
        mc^{2}\end{math} </formula></egXML></p><p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the subject of discussion within a technical document, itself encoded in XML. In such a document, it is clearly essential to distinguish clearly the markup occurring within examples from that marking up the document itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One simple solution is to use the predefined entity reference <code>&amp;lt;</code> to represent each &lt; character which marks the start of an XML tag within the examples. A more general solution is to mark off the whole body of each example as containing data which is not to be scanned for XML mark-up by the parser. This is achieved by enclosing it within a special XML construct called a <term><code>CDATA</code> marked section</term>, as in the following example: <eg xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;A list should be encoded as
       follows: &lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [ &lt;list&gt; &lt;item&gt;First item in the
       list&lt;/item&gt; &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/list&gt; ]]&gt; &lt;/eg&gt; The
       &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt;
       elements.</eg></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.list">&lt;list&gt;</ref> element used within the example above will not be regarded as forming part of the document proper, because it is embedded within a marked section (beginning with the special markup declaration <hi rend="val">&lt;![CDATA[ </hi>, and ending with <hi rend="val">]]&gt;</hi>).</p><p>Note also the use of the <ref target="#TEI.gi">&lt;gi&gt;</ref> element to tag references to element names (or <term>generic identifiers</term>) within the body of the text.</p></div><div><head>Generated Divisions</head><p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to generate automatically whole sections such as a table of contents or an index.

It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all occurrences of elements such as <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref> or <ref target="#TEI.name">&lt;name&gt;</ref> will often be a good departure point for an index.</p><p>The TEI schema provides a special purpose <ref target="#TEI.index">&lt;index&gt;</ref> tag which may be used to mark both the parts of the document which should be indexed, and how the indexing should be done. <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.index">index</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">index entry</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks a location to be indexed for whatever purpose.</seg></item></list></p><p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include the following:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">...

For example, in a study of Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's references to different figures, for comparative stylistic study. In the following lines of the <title>Metamorphoses</title>, such a study would record the poet's references to Jupiter (as <mentioned>deus</mentioned>, <mentioned>se</mentioned>, and as the subject of <mentioned>confiteor</mentioned> [in inflectional form number 227]), to Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as <mentioned>imago tauri fallacis</mentioned> and the subject of <mentioned>teneo</mentioned>), and so on.<note place="foot">The analysis is taken, with permission, from Willard McCarty and Burton Wright, <title>An Analytical Onomasticon to the Metamorphoses of Ovid</title> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming).

Other characters may also be represented by means of entity reference where necessary, for example to retain compatibility with a pre-Unicode processing system.</p></div><div xml:id="U5-fronbac"><head>Front and Back Matter</head><div><head>Front Matter</head><p>For many purposes, particularly in older texts, the preliminary material such as title pages, prefatory epistles, etc., may provide very useful additional linguistic or social information.

        </bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></egXML></p><p>Alternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special purpose classification scheme, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><taxonomy xml:id="B"><bibl>Brown Corpus</bibl><category xml:id="B.A"><catDesc>Press
           Reportage</catDesc><category xml:id="B.A1"><catDesc>Daily</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A2"><catDesc>Sunday</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A3"><catDesc>National</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A4"><catDesc>Provincial</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A5"><catDesc>Political</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.A6"><catDesc>Sports</catDesc></category></category><category xml:id="B.D"><catDesc>Religion</catDesc><category xml:id="B.D1"><catDesc>Books</catDesc></category><category xml:id="B.D2"><catDesc>Periodicals and
            tracts</catDesc></category></category></taxonomy></egXML></p><p>Linkage between a particular text and a category within such a taxonomy is made by means of the <ref target="#TEI.catRef">&lt;catRef/&gt;</ref> element within the <ref target="#TEI.textClass">&lt;textClass&gt;</ref> element, as described in the next section below.</p></div></div><div><head>The Profile Description</head><p>The <ref target="#TEI.profileDesc">&lt;profileDesc&gt;</ref> element enables information characterizing various descriptive aspects of a text to be recorded within a single framework. It has three optional components: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.creation">creation</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains information about the creation of a text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.langUsage">langUsage</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">language usage</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">describes the languages, sublanguages, registers, dialects, etc. represented within a text.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.textClass">textClass</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">text classification</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">groups information which describes the nature or topic of a text in terms of a standard classification scheme, thesaurus, etc.</seg></item></list></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.creation">&lt;creation&gt;</ref> element is useful for documenting where a work was created, even though it may not have been published or recorded there.</p><p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><creation><date when="1992-08">August 1992</date><name type="place">Taos, New Mexico</name></creation></egXML></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.langUsage">&lt;langUsage&gt;</ref> element is useful where a text contains many different languages. It may contain <ref target="#TEI.language">&lt;language&gt;</ref> elements to document each particular language used: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.language">language</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">characterizes a single language or sublanguage used within a text.</seg></item></list> For example, a text containing predominantly text in French as spoken in Quebec, but also smaller amounts of British and Canadian English might be documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><langUsage><language ident="fr-CA" usage="60">Québecois</language><language ident="en-CA" usage="20">Canadian business English</language><language ident="en-GB" usage="20">British English</language></langUsage></egXML></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.textClass">&lt;textClass&gt;</ref> element classifies a text. This may be done with reference to a classification system locally defined by means of the <ref target="#TEI.classDecl">&lt;classDecl&gt;</ref> element, or by reference to some externally defined established scheme such as the Universal Decimal Classification. Texts may also be classified using lists of keywords, which may themselves be drawn from locally or externally defined control lists. The following elements are used to supply such classifications: <list rend="specList"><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.classCode">classCode</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">classification code</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains the classification code used for this text in some standard classification system.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.catRef">catRef/</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">category reference</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">specifies one or more defined categories within some taxonomy or text typology.</seg></item><item><hi rend="specList-elementSpec"><ref target="#TEI.keywords">keywords</ref></hi><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><seg xml:lang="en">contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic or nature of a text.</seg></item></list></p><p>The simplest way of classifying a text is by means of the <ref target="#TEI.classCode">&lt;classCode&gt;</ref> element. For example, a text with classification 410 in the Universal Decimal Classification might be documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><classCode scheme="http://www.udc.org">410</classCode></egXML></p><p>When a classification scheme has been locally defined using the <ref target="#TEI.taxonomy">&lt;taxonomy&gt;</ref> element discussed in the preceding subsection, the <ref target="#TEI.catRef">&lt;catRef/&gt;</ref> element should be used to reference it. To continue the earlier example, a work classified in the Brown Corpus as <code>Press reportage - Sunday</code> and also as <code>Religion</code> might be documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catRef target="#B.A3 #B.D"/></egXML></p><p>The element <ref target="#TEI.keywords">&lt;keywords&gt;</ref> contains a list of keywords or phrases identifying the topic or nature of a text. As usual, the attribute <hi rend="att">scheme</hi> identifies the source from which these terms are taken. For example, if the LC Subject Headings are used, following declaration of that classification system in a <ref target="#TEI.taxonomy">&lt;taxonomy&gt;</ref> element as above : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><textClass><keywords scheme="#LCSH"><list><item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Data processing.</item><item>English literature -- History and criticism -- Theory etc.</item><item>English language -- Style -- Data processing.</item></list></keywords></textClass></egXML></p><p>Multiple classifications may be supplied using any of the mechanisms described in this section.</p></div><div><head>The Revision Description</head><p>The <ref target="#TEI.revisionDesc">&lt;revisionDesc&gt;</ref> element provides a change log in which each change made to a text may be recorded. The log may be recorded as a sequence of <ref target="#TEI.change">&lt;change&gt;</ref> elements each of which contains a brief description of the change. The attributes <hi rend="att">when</hi> and <hi rend="att">who</hi> may be used to identify when the change was carried out and the agency responsible for it.</p><p>Example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><revisionDesc><change when="1991-03-06" who="#EMB">File format updated</change><change when="1990-05-25" who="#EMB">Stuart's corrections entered</change></revisionDesc></egXML></p><p>In a production environment it will usually be found preferable to use some kind of automated system to track and record changes. Many such <term>version control systems</term>, as they are known, can also be configured to update the TEI Header of a file automatically.</p></div></div></body><back><div><head>List of Elements Described</head><p>The TEI Lite schema is a pure subset of TEI P5.

The <gi>delSpan</gi> element should be used for longer sequences of text, for those containing structural subdivisions, and for those containing overlapping additions and deletions.The text deleted must be at least partially legible in order for the encoder to be able to transcribe it (unless it is restored in a <gi>supplied</gi> tag). Illegible or lost text within a deletion may be marked using the <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> tag to signal that text is present but has not been transcribed, or is no longer visible. Attributes on the <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> element may be used to indicate how much text is omitted, the reason for omitting it, etc. If text is not fully legible, the <ref target="#TEI.unclear">&lt;unclear&gt;</ref> element (available when using the additional tagset for transcription of primary sources) should be used to signal the areas of text which cannot be read with confidence in a similar way.<lb/>Degrees of uncertainty over what can still be read, or whether a deletion was intended may be indicated by use of the <gi>certainty</gi> element (see <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CE.html#CE">21.</ref>).<lb/>There is a clear distinction in the TEI between <ref target="#TEI.del">&lt;del&gt;</ref> and <gi>surplus</gi> on the one hand and <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> or <ref target="#TEI.unclear">&lt;unclear&gt;</ref> on the other. <ref target="#TEI.del">&lt;del&gt;</ref> indicates a deletion present in the source being transcribed, which states the author's or a later scribe's intent to cancel or remove text. <gi>surplus</gi> indicates material present in the source being transcribed which should have been so deleted, but which is not in fact. <ref target="#TEI.gap">&lt;gap&gt;</ref> or <ref target="#TEI.unclear">&lt;unclear&gt;</ref>, by contrast, signal an editor's or encoder's decision to omit something or their inability to read the source text.

First, that no thief is to be spared who is caught with

            eightpence. <list rend="numbered"><item n="1.1">And if anyone does spare one, he is to pay for the thief with his

                clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item><item n="1.2">If, however, he [the thief] wishes to defend himself or to escape, he is
                not to be spared [whether younger or older than twelve].</item><item n="1.3">If a thief is put into prison, he is to be in prison 40 days, and he may
                then be redeemed with 120 shillings; and the kindred are to stand surety for him
                that he will desist for ever.</item><item n="1.4">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,
                or to bring him back there.</item><item n="1.5">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,
                whether to the king or to him to whom it rightly belongs; and everyone of those who
                supported him is to pay 120 shillings to the king as a fine.</item></list></item><item n="2">Concerning lordless men. And we pronounced about these lordless men, from whom
            no justice can be obtained, that one should order their kindred to fetch back such a
            person to justice and to find him a lord in public meeting. <list rend="numbered"><item n="2.1">And if they then will not, or cannot, produce him on that appointed day,

                or to clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item></list></item><item n="3">Concerning the refusal of justice. The lord who refuses justice and upholds
            his guilty man, so that the king is appealed to, is to repay the value of the goods and
            120 shillings to the king; and he who appeals to the king before he demands justice as
            often as he ought, is to pay the same fine as the other would have done, if he had
            refused him justice. <list rend="numbered"><item n="3.1">And the lord who is an accessory to a theft by his slave, and it becomes
                known about him, is to forfeit the slave and be liable to his wergild on the first
                occasionp if he does it more often, he is to be liable to pay all that he owns.</item><item n="3.2">And likewise any of the king's treasurers or of our reeves, who has been
                an accessory of thieves who have committed theft, is to liable to the same.</item></list></item><item n="4">Concerning treachery to a lord. And we have pronounced concerning treachery to

The <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref> element may be used to mark any of these. No position is taken on the philosophical issue of what a term can be; the looser definition simply allows the <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref> element to be used by practitioners of any persuasion.<lb/>As with other members of the <ident type="class">att.canonical</ident> class, instances of this element occuring in a text may be associated with a canonical definition, either by means of a URI (using the <hi rend="att">ref</hi> attribute), or by means of some system-specific code value (using the <hi rend="att">key</hi> attribute).

Data categories are defined as elementary descriptors in a linguistic structure. In the DCR data model each data category gets assigned a unique Peristent IDentifier (PID), i.e., an URI. Linguistic resources or preferably their schemas that make use of data categories from a DCR should refer to them using this PID. For XML-based resources, like TEI documents, ISO 12620:2009 normative Annex A gives a small Data Category Reference XML vocabulary (also available online at <ref xmlns:dcr="http://www.isocat.org/ns/dcr" target="http://www.isocat.org/12620/">http://www.isocat.org/12620/</ref>), which provides two attributes, <hi rend="att">dcr:datcat</hi> and <hi rend="att">dcr:valueDatcat</hi>.</cell></row></table></div><div type="refdoc" xml:id="TEI.att.declarable"><head>att.declarable</head><table rend="wovenodd"><row><cell cols="2" rend="wovenodd-col2"><hi rend="label">att.declarable</hi><index indexName="ODDS"><term>att.declarable (attribute class)</term><index indexName="ODDS"><term sortKey="default">@default</term></index></index> <seg xml:lang="en">provides attributes for those elements in the TEI header which may be independently selected by means of the special purpose <hi rend="att">decls</hi> attribute.</seg> [<ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CC.html#CCAS">15.3. </ref>]</cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Module</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2">tei</cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Members</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><hi rend="showmembers1"><ref target="#TEI.availability" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">availability</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.bibl" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">bibl</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.editorialDecl" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">editorialDecl</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.langUsage" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">langUsage</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.listBibl" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">listBibl</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.projectDesc" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">projectDesc</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.refsDecl" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">refsDecl</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.samplingDecl" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">samplingDecl</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.sourceDesc" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">sourceDesc</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.textClass" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">textClass</ref></hi></cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Attributes</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2">Attributes<table rend="attList"><row><cell rend="odd_label">default</cell><cell rend="odd_value"><seg xml:lang="en">indicates whether or not this element is selected by default when its parent is selected.</seg><table rend="attDef"><row><cell rend="odd_label"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Status</hi> </cell><cell rend="odd_value"><seg xml:lang="en">Optional</seg></cell></row><row><cell rend="odd_label"><hi xml:lang="en" rend="label">Datatype</hi> </cell><cell rend="odd_value"><eg rend="eg_rnc" xml:space="preserve">

The tag is made of the following subtags, in the following order. Every subtag except the first is optional. If present, each occurs only once, except the fourth and fifth components (variant and extension), which are repeatable. <list type="gloss"><label>language</label><item>The IANA-registered code for the language.

These codes consist of 4 letters, and it is recommended they be written with an initial capital, the other three letters in lower case. The canonical list of codes is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and is available at <ptr target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html"/>.

These should be used with great care, since they interfere with the interoperability that use of RFC 4646 is intended to promote.
